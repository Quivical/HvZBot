# HvZBot
A bot to assist with the facilitation and moderation of Humans versus Zombies.

This is the initial pre-release for the HvZBot. The bot is still in private testing, but if you would like to try it out in your server, please contact me on Discord at *quivical*.

This bot is being actively developed for Goucher College's Humans versus Zombies Club.
